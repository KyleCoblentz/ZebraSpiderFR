This folder contains the raw data and code that:
1) Performs the detection/handling time analysis
2) Estimates the average detection times for each feeding survey for each sex/stage
3) Collates all of the data into single .csv files for females, males, and juveniles for the functional response analysis

Explanation of Code:

DetectionTimeAnalysis.R -- This script performs the detection/handling time analysis and requires
  DetectionTimeData.csv

PreyAbundanceCorrections_DetectionTimes.R -- This script provides abundance corrections for midges across size classes for 
  abundances pre-standardization and calculates the mean detection time for each survey-sex/stage combination using the 
  detection time analysis from DetectionTimeAnalysis.R. The output of this script are the .csv files 'DetectionAvgAcrossInd_x.csv'
  
FeedingDataManipulation.R -- This script combines all of the necessary data from 'DetectionAvgAcrossInd_x.csv's, 
  'IndSpiderSurveys.csv', 'PreyAbundance.csv', 'SurveyInfo.csv', and 'WallInfo.csv' to output the files 'FeedingData_Manipulated_x.csv'
  which contains all of the information needed to fit the functional response models in single .csv files
