This folder contains the code to perform the Bayesian model averaging to get predictions for the relationships
between predator feeding rates and midge densities, temperature and space clearance rates, and interference 
for each stage/sex. 

The .R file 'ModelAveragingCode_FR' loads the .RData files 'xModelAvgData' where x is Female, Male, or Juvenile. 
It then gets Bayesian model-averaged predictions for the relationships between feeding rates and midge densities
for each sex/stage. 

The .R file 'ModelAveraging_Temperature' loads the .RData files 'xModelAvgData' where x is Female, Male, or Juvenile.
It then gets the Bayesian model-averaged predictions for the relationships between temperature and and space clearance
rates for each of sexes/stages.

The .R files 'Model_Averaging_Interference_x' where x is Female, Male or Juvenile use the respective 'xAvgData' .RData files
to get the model-averaged predictions of the effects of interference from each sex/stage on the focal sex/stage. These .R files 
produce the respective 'x_Int_Plot' .RData files. 

The .R file 'Interference_CombinedPlot' loads the 'x_Int_Plot' .RData files where x is Female, Male, or Juvenile, and 
produces the combined figure with predictions of the effects of interference on each sex/stage from each sex/stage.
