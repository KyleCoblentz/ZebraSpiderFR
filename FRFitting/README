This folder contains four folders. Three of these folders include the code and collated data used to fit the functional responses for females,
males, and juveniles (folders titled 'Females', 'Males', and 'Juveniles'). The fourth folder 'ModelAveraging' contains the code that 
performs the Bayesian model averaging for the model-averaged predictions in the manuscript using output from the code to fit the 
functional responses.
