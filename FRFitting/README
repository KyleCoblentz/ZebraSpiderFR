This repository contains the data and code used to fit the parameteric functional responses to
observational feeding data for zebra jumping spiders in Coblentz et al. Quantifying predator 
functional responses under field conditions reveals interactive effects of temperature and 
interference with sex and stage. 

There are two folders: Females and Juveniles. Each folder contains the data and code for the parameteric
functional response fits for female and juvenile zebra jumping spiders.
