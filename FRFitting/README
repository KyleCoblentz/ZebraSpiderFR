This folder contains four folders. Three folders include the code and collated data used to fit the functional responses for females,
males, and juveniles (folders titled 'Females', 'Males', and 'Juveniles'). The fourth folder contains the code used to perform the 
Bayesian model averaging to get predictions for the relationships between feeding rates and midge densities, temperature and space
clearance rates, and interference for each stage/sex.
